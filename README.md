This is basically an e-commerce website which will help in spreading awereness in the society 
and also sell all the necessary products which are required during this covid pandemic.
This is our college project.

A visual studio is a IDE.
An integrated development environment (IDE) for developing, editing, and debugging websites, web, 
and mobile applications as well as cloud services. Because it's an IDE, programming utilities like 
a debugger, compiler, intellisence, and more are all bundled into it for you.
